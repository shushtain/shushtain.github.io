                    <h1>KharkivPride</h1>
                    <p>KharkivPride is an annual LGBT+ Pride event in&nbsp;Kharkiv, Ukraine. It focuses
                        on&nbsp;visibility
                        and&nbsp;counteracting stigma.
                    </p>
                    <p>Kharkiv is a city of concrete buildings, so&nbsp;the&nbsp;metaphor of the identity is about
                        rainbow beams
                        that crash concrete
                        walls, challenge outdated norms and traditions that work against LGBT+ community.</p>
